# RxExperiments

These are the artifacts from my process of learning RxSwift…

Some might be useful, most probably aren't...

- `operators.txt` — list of RxSwift operators — use to test your recall without looking at actual documentation or code
- `viewmodels/` — an experiment in mixing RxSwift with the React-like approach to data flow and UI building
