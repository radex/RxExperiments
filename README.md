# RxExperiments

These are the artifacts from my process of learning RxSwift… This _might_ be useful to someone, but probably isn't…

- `basics/` — start here…
  - `operators.txt` — list of RxSwift operators — use to test your recall without looking at actual documentation or code
  - `Playground.swift` — this is where I learned all the RxSwift concepts and operators, played with RxCocoa, RxTest, RxBlocking. (To run, you'd have to copy&paste the file's contents to a playground that can `import` the 4 RxSwift frameworks)
- `extensions/` — experimental extensions to RxSwift/RxCocoa
- `viewmodels/` — an experiment in mixing RxSwift with the React-like approach to data flow and UI building
